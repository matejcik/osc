osclib - a thin OBS API wrapper
===============================

This repository hosts the initial version of __`osclib`__.

No tests or anything reasonable at this point. It is also based on a forked
[osc](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc) repository, because it has a runtime dependency
on osc and because I expect osc to become user of osclib at some point,
and right now I don't want to deal with the dependencies the right way.

See [the blog post](https://matejcik.blogspot.cz/2017/08/scripting-open-build-service-from.html)
to learn what this is about.

See [gists](https://gist.github.com/matejcik/99c0180e7d7614a0601db2b993f013f6)
for some usage examples.
